Course Outcomes:
1. Memorize the variable usability, conditional checking, looping structure.
2. Differentiate the data storage and accessibility from various types of data storage.
3. Illustrating the functionality of breaking down the task and reusing the code using
functions.
4. Building the data hierarchy using Inheritance by classes and objects.
5. Apply the functionality to store/retrieve the input and output data on the
permanent basis.
6. Create the GUI applications to solve real-life problems and Develop the various
graphs to visualize the data.
